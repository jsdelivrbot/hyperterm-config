# hyper-dark-scrollbar
Pretty scrollbar for [hyper](https://github.com/zeit/hyper).

A plugin that stylizes the chunky Windows-ish scrollbar into a more sleek scrollbar.

The scrollbar is designed for [hyperterm-atom-dark](https://github.com/mdo/hyperterm-atom-dark), however, it also looks great on the standard theme, and should look fine on dark themes. Please do create a fork if you want your own custom, personal style, or to fit your theme better.
